Due to this rapid spread, Europeans viewed the Native American populations as sicker and thinner than normal. </p>\n<p>To address our original question, disease spread organically far more than by European force. Smallpox blankets and other forms of biological warfare may have hurt small groups of Natives during battle, but many Native Americans caught diseases before seeing a European. </p>",
