post__entry"><p>           Many misconceptions surround the Columbian Exchange—the “exchange of diseases, ideas, food crops, and populations between the New World and the Old World”—particularly those of an idyllic pre-Columbian disease-free New World and the Eurocentric “replacement theory” idea of a nonviolent and uncontested conquest of the New World.  With this project we aim to overturn some of those theories through their relationships to the spread of smallpox over time during the Columbian Exchange. We especially aim to use the lens of virgin soil epidemics and their impact on populations to prove that the colonization of the New World relied upon European violence against Native populations.</p><p>            A virgin soil epidemic is an outbreak of a disease that a population has never been exposed to—a well-known example of this is the smallpox virus’ effect on the New World.  Virgin soil epidemics were not unknown in the Old World—epidemics were unavoidable, especially with only a vague awareness of proper healthcare for victims of an epidemic. According to historian Suzanne Austin Alchon, all traditional medicinal systems share common factors including a dual curative/prophylactic purpose, a basis in drug therapy, and a search for the explanation of diseases’ causes.  These common responses in societies from Cuzco to Paris reveal the universal nature of societies’ reactions to virgin soil epidemics. However, in every other recorded case of a virgin soil epidemic, the native population remained a dominant power in their region. The sole exception our initial research turned up was the case of the Columbian Exchange, wherein European descendants now make up the majority of the population of the New World.  What made this outbreak so different?</p><p>            One hypothesis formulated by a number of Europeans visiting the New World under Spanish colonial rule was the “Black Legend,” a popular name for the ideas promulgated by Spanish priest Bartolomeo de las Casas.  The Black Legend essentially says that the brutality of Spanish colonial practices, especially against “small children, old men, pregnant women, and even women who had just given birth,” was the sole source of the collapse of Native civilizations in the New World (Alchon).  This rhetoric, while politically beneficial to Spain’s rivals and based mostly on observation (however exaggerated some of it may be), downplayed the role of diseases from the Old World in the conquest of the Americas. This theory is also related to a second error in historical thought: the common preconceived notion of an idyllic pre-Columbian disease-free world where every Native society lived peacefully, with no internal conflict nor existing epidemics.  As records show peoples in the Americas had their own manners of dealing with sickness, this is obviously not the case; it also feeds into a paternalistic attitude towards Native peoples in popular culture by treating Native Americans as a monolithic entity, as opposed to distinct cultural groups that often came into conflict with each other.</p><p>            In countering the exaggerations present in the formation of the Black Legend, some historians arrived at the conclusion that virgin soil epidemics such as smallpox were the overwhelming source of Native deaths from colonization, some going so far as to say that brutality on the part of the four major colonial powers (Spain, France, England, and Portugal) was negligible as disease was believed to have killed the majority of the population.  This flawed argument proved to have vast cultural ramifications in modern understandings of colonialism as well; it contributed to subconscious beliefs of white Americans being “original to place” in a phenomenon called the replacement narrative (Gilio-Whitaker). Modern historians’ hyperfixation on the diseases brought from the Old World to the New World led to a general ignorance of European violence against Native Americans, only contributing further to the narrative that Europeans arrived and simply replaced Native populations.  This obfuscates a long history of documented violence against Natives, as well as giving many Americans permission to ignore current patterns of environmental violence and physical violence on Native Americans.</p><p>              Our findings show that the replacement narrative has some small basis in truth, but that too great of a focus on the importance of disease in the Columbian Exchange leads to popular ignorance of the role European brutality played in the conquest of the Americas.  Evidence from multiple accounts confirms that non-Nahua visitors to Tenochtitlan, such as the Tarascan people, likely contracted smallpox from Europeans arriving in Tenochtitlan, and they then returned to outlying cities (Schwartz). The European colonizers would then arrive at these towns to find many dead and dying from disease, assuming that the epidemic could not have possibly come from the Europeans themselves.  While the replacement narrative may be loosely rooted in fact, it still ignores the fact that European violence was necessary to subjugate the Native populations of the Americas. Our expected data from future research will also hopefully negate the common paternalistic assumption that the New World was free of disease and conflict; we hope to map distinct pre-Columbian nations as well as the spread of syphilis, which we believe Christopher Columbus and his crew to have acquired in the West Indies and brought back to Europe, where it caused outbreaks in Spain.  Our current findings suggest that a combination of European colonial violence and the great impact of smallpox outbreaks were the reason that the Columbian Exchange was the sole major virgin soil epidemic to result in near-total population replacement.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://newworldepidemiology.github.io/Project/authors/pavan/" class="invert" rel="author">Pavan Tauh</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://newworldepidemiology.github.io/Project/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://newworldepidemiology.github.io/Project/map.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Map of Diseases</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://newworldepidemiology.github.io/Project/abstract.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Abstract </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://newworldepidemiology.github.io/Project/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5">Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
